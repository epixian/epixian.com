Lauren Dellabella is a foodie par excellence. Actually, foodie isn’t the right word — she’s a connoisseur of culinary creations, and equally talented in photography as she is in cooking. Recognizing these gifts, she decided to share them with the world in the form of a food blog.

Like many other bloggers, she started out using, well, Blogger. As her site grew, so did her appetite for greater control in how her work was being showcased. She hired a website designer who migrated her site over to WordPress, utilizing one of the more common migration plugins available online.

Nearly a hundred of her earliest images, however, stayed put on the free blogger.com domain, and her website developer installed a plugin that was able to use these externally-hosted images as featured images in WordPress without having to import them into WordPress itself.

Relying on a third-party plugin to do this job, however, was a risky solution. Every now and then an update to the plugin would crash the site and/or prevent those images from appearing. Oftentimes, this behavior would be corrected in a later update (sometimes days or weeks later), but it was clear that the plugin developer did not extensively test his work, if at all.

Lauren asked one of her friends for a solution, who then recommended her to EPIXIAN. Our WordPress team was able to hash out a custom plugin that identified affected posts, imported the external image into WordPress, and set it as the featured image, leaving Laura a happy and satisfied customer.

In addition to custom WordPress theme/plugin development, EPIXIAN can also leverage page builders for quick turnaround of new and existing site designs. We do work for individuals, businesses, nonprofits, and more. Contact us today for a consultation.
